# trailr

**NOTE:  these are very early experiments and should be considered pre-alpha**

[D3-trail](https://github.com/bmschmidt/D3-trail) for R through an htmlwidget.  As of now the most likely application for me would be `chart.SnailTrail` from `PerformanceAnalytics`.  However, seeing this example of the [Minard map](http://benschmidt.org/D3-trail/minard.html) from the D3-trail author demonstrates the fuller potential of this widget.
